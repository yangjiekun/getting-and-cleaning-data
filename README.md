## Course project of getting and cleaning data on Coursera
=============================================================
This repo includes the original UCI HAR dataset, an R script for tidy data preparation (run_analysis.R), a code book (CodeBook.md), and two tidy data files (tidy_data.txt and tidy_data2.txt).

By running run_analysis.R on the original UCI HAR dataset, tidy data files as described in the code book were generated. Please refer to CodeBook.md and UCI HAR Dataset/README.txt for more details about the data set.
